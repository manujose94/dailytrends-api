## Description 📄

DailyTrends is an API that exposes a news feed aggregator. This feed collects news from different newspapers, focusing on the top headlines from leading newspapers. When a user accesses DailyTrends, they will see the top 5 headlines from `El País`,  `El Mundo` or `BBC` for the current day. Additionally, users can manually add news articles through the API.

### Architecture 🏛️

The **Clean Architecture** principles is used, which divide issues into layers and guarantee that business logic and infrastructure concerns are kept distinct from one another. Principal benefits consist of:

- **Maintainability**: The codebase is easier to maintain and update when there is a clear separation of concerns.
- **Scalability**: The architecture permits the system to expand and change without requiring significant reorganization.
- **Testability**: Comprehensive unit testing is made possible by the isolation of business logic from external dependencies.
- **Adaptability**: Modifications to external frameworks or dependencies little affect the main business logic.

#### Diagram 📊

Overall clean architecture with a focus on the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph domain["Domain (Domain Layer)"]
        direction TB
    end

    subgraph application["Application (Application Layer)"]
        direction TB
    end

    subgraph adapters["Adapters (Adapter Layer)"]
        direction TB
    end

    subgraph infrastructure["Infrastructure (Infrastructure Layer)"]
        direction TB
    end

    domain --> application
    application --> adapters
    adapters --> infrastructure
```

## Usage 🚀

### Environment Variables 🌐

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Below is a table describing each environment variable:

| Variable                   | Description                                         | Default Value                            |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`           | Secret key for JWT authentication.                  | `default_secret_key`                     |
| `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`| MongoDB connection string.                          | `mongodb://localhost:27018/mydatabase`   |
| `REDIS_URL`                | Redis server URL.                                   | `localhost`                              |
| `REDIS_PORT`               | Redis server port.                                  | `6379`                                   |
| `NODE_ENV`                 | Environment the application is running in.          | `development`                            |
| `PORT`                     | The port on which the application runs.             | `3000`                                   |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`     | Timeframe for rate limit in milliseconds.           | `900000` (15 minutes)                    |

### Running the Application ▶️

1. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start `mongo` and `redis` via `docker-compose`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up mongo redis
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

> This will run the compiled JavaScript files located in the `dist` directory.

### Makefile 🧪

To run **just your application and its dependencies** (API, MongoDB, Redis):

```bash
make up
# Default: ENV=des then use .env_des file
```

This command starts only the services relevant to development:

- Your TypeScript API (`app`)
- MongoDB (`mongo`)
- Redis (`redis`)

Great for debugging, writing code, or doing manual QA locally.

To shut it down:

```bash
make reset ENV=des
```

### Development Mode 👩‍💻

To run the application in development mode with a MongoDB and Redis connection string:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up mongo redis
   export MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27018/mydatabase && /
   npm run start:dev
   ```

> This script sets the MongoDB and Redis connection string environment variables (URL to connect `docker-compose up mongo redis`) and starts the application.

### Docker Usage 🐳

First, use the `.env` file based on the `.env_example` template:

```plaintext
# .env_example File
# Environment variables for application
JWT_SECRET_KEY=default_secret_key
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27018/mydatabase
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT=100
REDIS_URL=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

This case uses a multi-stage Docker build to separate development and production environments:

#### Development Image 🛠️

```bash
docker build --target development -t dailytrends-dev .
docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 dailytrends-dev
```

```bash
# Run the container with live-reloading:
docker run --env-file .env -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app -v /usr/src/app/node_modules -p 3000:3000 dailytrends-dev
```

> Note: The development image is designed to make the development process easier by providing live-reloading using **nodemon** and **ts-node**. This setup ensures that changes to your source files are immediately reflected in the running application, without needing to rebuild the container.

#### Production Image 📦

```bash
docker build --target production -t dailytrends-prod .
docker run --env-file .env -p 80:3000 dailytrends-prod
```

### Testing 🧪

Run integration tests using:

   ```bash
   # All tests
   npm run test 

   # Only Integration tests
   npm run test:integration

   #RUn with coverage thresholds 80
    npm run test:coverage
   ```

### Code Formatting and Linting 🧹

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

To lint TypeScript files:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

For automatically fixing linting errors:

   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

### API Documentation 📜

Swagger has been implemented via comments to automatically generate the API specification:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000/api/v1/api-docs
   ```

> NOTE: This is feasible for small projects like this one, but for larger projects it is advisable to create a separate specification file manually.

## Best Practices 🌟

Resume of best practices followed to ensure code quality, maintainability, and security:

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Specify the exact version of each dependency to ensure consistent builds, so avoid unexpected behavior due to dependency updates.
2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Configurable information, such as Database connection strings, or data configuration.
   > `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Secure your application by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   > `jsonwebtoken` for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and `bcrypt` for hashing passwords
4. **Security**:
   - Implement measures to mitigate common security threats, such as:
     - Using `bcrypt` for secure password hashing.
     - Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms with `jsonwebtoken`.
     - Integrating `express-rate-limit` to prevent DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address or user.
5. **Documentation**
   - Maintain clear documentation for the API:
      - Using `Swagger and OpenAPI` for documentation API endpoints, expected inputs, and outputs.
6. **MongoDB Connection with Backoff**:
   - Implement a robust MongoDB connection strategy with exponential backoff to handle connection retries gracefully.
   - Advantages include improved reliability in unstable network conditions and reduced overload on MongoDB servers.
7. **Redis for Caching**:
   - Use Redis for efficient caching to improve application performance when used to scrape content.
   - Connection strategy with exponential backoff
   - Set appropriate expiration times for cache entries, e.g., `EX: 7200` (2 hours), to ensure data freshness and optimal memory usage.
