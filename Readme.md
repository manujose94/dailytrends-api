## Description

DailyTrends is an API that exposes a news feed aggregator. This feed collects news from different newspapers, focusing on the top headlines from leading newspapers. When a user accesses DailyTrends, they will see the top 5 headlines from `El PaÃ­s` and `El Mundo` for the current day. Additionally, users can manually add news articles through the API.

### Architecture

The **Clean Architecture** principles is used, which divide issues into layers and guarantee that business logic and infrastructure concerns are kept distinct from one another. Principal benefits consist of:

- **Maintainability**: The codebase is easier to maintain and update when there is a clear separation of concerns.
- **Scalability**: The architecture permits the system to expand and change without requiring significant reorganization.
- **Testability**: Comprehensive unit testing is made possible by the isolation of business logic from external dependencies.
- **Adaptability**: Modifications to external frameworks or dependencies little affect the main business logic.

### Object Oriented Designs

Throughout the project's development, the SOLID principles have been followed, which combined help to maintain a clean architectural structure and improve the project's overall quality and maintainability.

## Principals Tools

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript
- Express
- Eslint
- Jest
- Swagger and Postman
- Prettier
- Docker

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```~~bash~~
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the TypeScript files to JavaScrip:

```bash
npx tsc
```

## Usage

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Below is a table describing each environment variable:

| Variable                   | Description                                         | Default Value                            |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`           | Secret key for JWT authentication.                  | `default_secret_key`                     |
| `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`| MongoDB connection string.                          | `mongodb://localhost:27010/mydatabase`   |
| `NODE_ENV`                 | Environment the application is running in.          | `development`                            |
| `PORT`                     | The port on which the application runs.             | `3000`                                   |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`     | Timeframe for rate limit in milliseconds.           | `900000` (15 minutes)                    |


### Running the Application

1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start `mongo` via `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose up mongo   
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

> This will run the compiled JavaScript files located in the `dist` directory.

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with a MongoDB connection string:

```bash
docker-compose up mongo 

npm run start:dev
```

> This script sets the MongoDB connection string environment variable ( url to connect `docker-compose up mongo `) and starts the application.

### Docker Usage

First, use `.env` file based on the `.env_example` template:

```bash
### .env_example File
```plaintext
# Environment variables for application
JWT_SECRET_KEY=default_secret_key
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27010/mydatabase
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT=100
```

In this case the multi-stage Docker build to separate development and production environments:

#### Development Image

```bash
docker build --target development -t dailytrends-dev .
docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 dailytrends-dev
```

#### Production Image

```bash
docker build --target production -t dailytrends-prod .
docker run --env-file .env -p 80:3000 dailytrends-prod
```

### Testing

Run integration tests using:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Code Formatting and Linting

```bash
npm run format
```

To lint TypeScript files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

For automatically fixing linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Api Documentation

Swagger has been implemented via comment to automatically generate the API specification:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

> NOTE: This is feasible for small projects like this one, but for larger projects it is advisable to create a separate specification file manually.

## Best Practices

Resume of best practices followed to ensure code quality, maintainability, and security:

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Specify the exact version of each dependency to ensure consistent builds, so avoid unexpected behavior due to dependency updates.
2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Configurable information, such as Database connection strings, or data configuration.   
   >  `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Secure your application by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   > `jsonwebtoken` for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and `bcrypt` for hashing passwords
4. **Security**:
   - Implement measures to mitigate common security threats, such as:
     - Using `bcrypt` for secure password hashing.
     - Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms with `jsonwebtoken`.
     - Integrating `express-rate-limit` to prevent DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address or user.
5. **Documentation**
   -  Maintain clear documentation for the API:
      - Using `Swagger and OpenAPI` for documentation API endpoints, expected inputs, and outputs.

### CI/CD Workflows

#### 1. Run Tests

- **File**: `test_code.yml`
- **Description**: This workflow is triggered on pushes or pull requests to the `main` or `develop` branches. It runs tests for the project.
> Serves as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) process, ensuring that changes introduced to the codebase do not break existing functionality.

#### 2. Code Quality and Bug Detection

- **File**: `check_code.yml`
- **Description**: This workflow is also triggered on pushes or pull requests to the `main` or `develop` branches. It focuses on code quality checks using ESLint.
> Contributes to the Continuous Integration (CI) process by enforcing code quality standards and detecting potential bugs early in the development cycle.

#### 3. Build Image and Push to Registry

- **File**: `build-and-publish.yml`
- **Description**: This workflow has a more complex triggering mechanism. It's triggered on pushes to the `main` branch, specific version tags, or closed pull requests to the `main` branch. It builds a Docker image and pushes it to a container registry.
> Handles aspects of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). It automates the process of building and deploying containerized applications, ensuring consistency and reliability across environments.

#### 4. Automate Release Creation

- **File**: `automate-release.yml`
- **Description**: This workflow is triggered when pull requests are closed on the `main` branch or manually triggered. It automates the creation of GitHub releases based on pull request information.
> Handles aspects of Continuous Deployment (CD) by 88automatically creating releases** on GitHub when changes are merged into the `main` branch.
